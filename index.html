                Pokemon Fire Red is a remake, not only was it one but Fire Red came
                out with another version which is LeafGreen. These two games came
                out in 2004 and since they are remakes of games that came out before
                they have the same story to the game they remake. So this game
                (Pokemon Fire Red) has the same story as Pokemon Red, a boy who has
                just turned 10 and chooses his first pokemon and starts his
                adventure. The story focuses on the Protagonist completing the
                pokedex at the request of Professor Oak and in which on his way he
                encounters adversities and stoppages in which the protagonist will
                have to solve in order to complete the game.
